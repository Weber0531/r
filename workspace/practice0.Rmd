## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
level<-c("a","b")
n<-rep(level)
print(n)
y1=c(2,3,4,5)
y2<-c(33,44,55,66)
df<-data.frame(n,y1,y2)
a<-ggplot(df,aes(x=n))+geom_line(aes(y=y1))
a
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
